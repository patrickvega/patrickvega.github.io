<p>I grew up in <a href="http://www.welcomechile.com/losangeles/index_i.html" target="_blank">Los Ángeles</a>, Chile.<br>
<br>
In March 2008, I moved to <a href="http://www.welcomechile.com/concepcion/index_i.html" target="_blank">Concepción</a>, Chile, to study Mathematical Engineering. In March 2014, I received my degree in Mathematical Engineering from Universidad de Concepcion, where I worked on locking-free finite element methods for elastodynamics problems in thin structures with my advisers Rodolfo Rodriguez and Frank Sanhueza.<br>
<br>
In March 2014, I started my PhD in Applied Sciences with a minor in Mathematical Engineering from Universidad de Concepcion. I worked on my PhD thesis, "Adaptive and high order hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) methods in fluid mechanics", with my advisers Rodolfo Araya, Weifeng Qiu, and Manuel Solano.<br>
<br>
I moved to France in December 2019. There, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Inria Sophia Antípolis - Méditerranée with Théophile Chaumont-Frelet and Stéphane Lanteri on a posteriori error estimations for finite element and HDG discretizations of Maxwell's equations and related models.<br>
<br>
In June 2021, I moved to <a href="http://www.welcomechile.com/valparaiso/index_i.html" target="_blank">Valparaíso</a>, Chile. Here I'm working as a postdoctoral researcher in the Institute of Mathematics at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso with Ignacio Muga on minimum residual finite element methods and on solving partial differential equations using neural networks.
